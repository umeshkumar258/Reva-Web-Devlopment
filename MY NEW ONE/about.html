        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is [Your Name], and I am passionate about web development and technology. I have always been fascinated by how websites and applications are built, which led me to pursue a career in this exciting field. Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly learning new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to coding, I enjoy solving complex problems and collaborating with others to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I believe that technology has the power to make a positive impact on people's lives, and I strive to contribute to that through my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of programming, I love reading, exploring new places, and spending time with friends and family. I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow both personally and professionally.
        </p>
